# ECCE-2020
This repostiroy contains the code for ECCE 2020

This repository contains the code for the 2020 ECCE paper. This code implemented the attack detection and diagnosis based on micro-PMU data using Pytorch deep learning framework and sklearn.

Usage:

- Run 'preprocessing_normalization.m' in Matlab under the raw data directory to do the preprocessing and normalization.
- Run 'main.py' to train the model and get the test result. Note that all the methods are included in one file, feel free to change and uncomment the one you don't need.
